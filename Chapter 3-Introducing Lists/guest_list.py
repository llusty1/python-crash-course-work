# This exercise is to create a list of at least 3 people you'd like to invite to dinner.
list = ["Michael Jordan", "Shaquille O'Neal", "Charles Barkley",]
print(list)
# Now let's create a message to each guest that you'd like to invite.
message = "Dear Mr. " + list[0] + " we humbly invite you to dinner. "
print(message)
message = "Dear Mr. " + list[1] + " we humbly invite you to dinner. "
print(message)
message = "Dear Mr. " + list[2] + " we humbly invite you to dinner. " 
print(message)
# This took me a minute, I will learn if there is a more efficient way of doing this.
