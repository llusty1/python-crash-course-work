#This exercise is meant to list two variables famous_person and message then we print it out!
famous_person = "Albert Einstein"
message = "once said, 'The person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."
print(famous_person, message) # I figured out that using a comma here would work. 
# Another way of doing this would be to use the f-string
print(f"{famous_person},{message}")
# Both ways produce the exact same results.
