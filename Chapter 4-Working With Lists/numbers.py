# This exercise will work with numbers 
# Let's use the range() function
for value in range(1, 5):
    print(value)

# Since Python is one off, let's print the range() function for 1-5
for value in range(1, 6):
    print(value)

# Using range() to make a list of numbers 
numbers = list(range(1,6))
print(numbers)
